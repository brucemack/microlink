This file contains the details for the version 3 (ML3) of the MicroLink hardware.
This is the first version that has a real enclosure so we are paying more attention
to mechanical detail.

# Enclosure Considerations
## Connectors That Penetrate the Enclosure
* DC power connector - 5.5mm jack, male center pin. 
* Signal/audio connector - DB9, female.
## Indicators That Penetrate the Enclosure
* Three indicator LEDs - D1 Red, D3 blue, D4 green
## Thermal 
* The 3.3V LDO gets warm so there should be airflow in that vicinity
